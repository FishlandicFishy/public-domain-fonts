These encodings are intended for use in FontForge. Only public domain encoding files are included. Format of encodings may be edited for ease of use.

| Name | Chinese Name | Target Source | File Source |

| [big5e (Big-5E)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big5#Big-5E) | 五大碼擴充 | T |<https://github.com/chinese-opendesktop/cin-tables/blob/master/big5e.cin> |

A reference file for CCCII is available at `cin-tables` of `chinese-opendesktop`, but it is too big for FontForge to read. The same goes for the CNS files at both the aforementioned source and the Unicode mapping files, but the CNS encoding is not in the public domain, and thus will not be included.

For other **non-public domain** encoding files, you may refer to <https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/> for CJK encodings and <https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/> for other encodings.

Note that FontForge does NOT save CJK encodings properly, so it is advised to name such encodings **with a space included** to stop FontForge from saving them and to avoid confusion.
