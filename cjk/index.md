# CJK Fonts

## Other public domain-equivalent fonts available on GitHub

(that I'm too lazy to put here)

* [Jigmo](https://kamichikoichi.github.io/jigmo): formerly included, but too big of a file to maintain
* [LorchinSans](https://github.com/Losketch/LorchinSans) (formerly OFL-licensed, now licensed under the WTFPL)
* [SaitamaarFont](https://github.com/asciiart-development/SaitamaarFont) (listed as OFL to fulfil Google Fonts requirements, but formerly in the public domain)
* [Sophora](https://github.com/MihailJP/Sophora): too big of a file
