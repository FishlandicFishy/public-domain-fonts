# Outline CJK Fonts

| Font | Type | Source | Link | Derivative? |
| --- | -- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jigmo | Song | J | <https://kamichikoichi.github.io/jigmo/> | GlyphWiki glyphs |
| Oradano Mincho\* | Song | J | <https://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~sd5a-ucd/freefonts/Oradano-Mincho/> | Mostly "築地三号活字" found in dictionaries |

\*: These are relatively low quality scans; some glyphs are blocky while some are smoothed out

Also note that Oradano Mincho incorrectly uses the glyph for 儘 for 侭 and 厓 for U+FA55 突.
